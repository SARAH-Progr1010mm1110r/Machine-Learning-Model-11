**Create a neural network to predict heart disease**

* Create a deep learning model to predict heart disease in populations at risk.

* Data Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction]

* Create a neural network to predict heart disease using the given data:

* Explore and clean the data if needed
* Perform a train-test split on the data
* Use a column transformer to scale the numeric features and one-hot encode the categorical features.
* Define base sequential model
* Include the number of features of each sample in input layer
* Use the correct activation function and the correct number of neurons for your output layer
* Compile the model with the correct loss function and an optimizer (‘adam’ is a fine choice)
* Plot your model’s training history.
* Evaluate the models with appropriate metrics.
* After you have created, fit, and evaluated your first model, try 2 more versions of it with different numbers of layers and neurons to see if you can create a model that scores better on the testing data.
